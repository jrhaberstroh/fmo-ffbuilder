prm2gmx
====================================================================================================

prm2gmx converts the data from the Marchi Forcefield (2002) for BChl into a gromacs-compatible style.



How to use
====================================================================================================

Putting new atomtypes into gromacs is not a trivial procedure. Because the data is provided in a more
generic format (i.e. in a format of atomtypes, bonded names, and bond descriptions), the data must be
run through pdb2gmx to generate a self-sufficient .itp file.

The most successful procedure is probably to create a complete set of forcefield files in a single
directory (without modifying an existing forcefield) to allow pdb2gmx to generate an .itp file for 
the molecule. Alternatively, the parameters can be added to an existing forcefield, and the entire
macromolecule can be run through pdb2gmx to generate the .itp files on the fly.

There are several files which must be modified to successfully generate the topology with pdb2gmx:
    1) atomtypes.atm - Atom types (of any length), with masses
    2) ffbonded.itp - Valence bond parameters between atomtypes for generic ff generation (bond, 
        angle, dihedral, and improper dihedral)
    3) ffnonbonded.itp - Non-bonded parameters for atomtypes in atomtypes.atm (atomic number, 
        mass, default charge (conventionally zero), sigma, and epsilon
    4) bcl.rtp - Describes the map from redundant atomtypes to unique atomnames in residue [BCL], 
        the charges and charge groups, then specifies the bonds, angles, dihedrals, and impropers 
        topology for the molecule
    5) bcl.hdb - Describes the location of hydrogens for pdb2gmx to generate and their proper
        structure. (I think that ambertools can do this automatically, though...)

Using these, it should be possible to successfully run pdb2gmx and generate a .itp file for BCL,
which can then be updated to include type A and type B charge densities for free-energy calculations.
